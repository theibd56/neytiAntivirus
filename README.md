# NEYTI Antivirus

NEYTI Antivirus is an open source antivirus written in C#.

The purpose of this project is to create a graduate thesis project that is positioned as a free, community-driven antivirus that can be easily modified to work in closed environments.

It has no databases included, and at this point, in can be used only as a basis for more complicated projects. Content for the database can be taken from https://virusshare.com/hashes

##Compatibility

It was not tested on systems other than Windows (8, 8.1, 10) and it probably will never be.
